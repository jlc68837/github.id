	<p> Like most sports, wrestling is a sport in which every point matters, but statistics show that in fact <b> the first two points matter more than the rest of the points. </b> In the NCAA (College) Wrestling Tournament, the best wrestlers in the country gather and compete in the hardest tournament of the year. The best wrestlers make their way through the bracket until there are only two left. The best two wrestlers in the country go toe to toe in the NCAA Wrestling Finals. For the past few years many statistics have been tracked in this final match to help amateur wrestlers and coaches recognize the area of the sport they need to improve in, and the area of the sport in which could be the most important for success. Look no further than obtaining the first takedown of the match. Statistics are in your favor if you get these first points.
</p> 	
<p> As shown in the table below, during the <b> 2016 NCAA Wrestling Championship Finals </b> the wrestler who scored the first takedown (received the first two points) won <b> 70% </b> of the matches.
</p>

<table border=3>

<tr>
<th> <em> Year </em> </th><th> <em>First Takedown Win Percentage </em> </th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2014</td><td>80%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2015</td><td>70%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2016</td><td>70%</td>
</tr>

</table>
 <p> Based off of statistics it is conclusive from the highest level of wrestling that scoring the first takedown is very important. It is substantial that you are aggressive early in the match in hopes to get the first takedown. While there is still a chance you can prevail victorious without the first takedown, the statistics show it is not very probable. 
For all of the wrestlers looking for the most important opportunity in a match... it is in fact the first.
